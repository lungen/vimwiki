=== What is an algorithm? ===

Any computing problem can be solved by executing a series of actions in a specific order.
A procedure for solving a problem in terms of
    1. the actions to execute and
    2. the order in which these actions execute
is called an algorithm.


=== What is a pseudocode? ===
Pseudocode is an informal language that helps you develop algorithms without having to
worry about the strict details of (Java) language syntax. The pseudocode we present is par-
ticularly useful for developing algorithms that will be converted to structured portions of
(Java) programs.
