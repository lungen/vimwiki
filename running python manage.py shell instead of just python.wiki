If you’ve used Python before, you may be wondering why we’re running _python manage.py shell_ 
instead of just python (or python3). Both commands will start the interactive interpreter, 
but the manage.py shell command has one key difference: before starting the interpreter, 
it tells Django which settings file to use.

Many parts of Django, including the template system, rely on your settings, and you won’t 
be able to use them unless the framework knows which settings to use.If you’re curious, 
here’s how it works behind the scenes. Django looks for an environment variable called 
*DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE*, which should be set to the import path of your settings.py. For 
example, *DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE* might be set to 'mysite.settings', assuming mysite is on 
your Python path.

When you run python manage.py shell, the command takes care of setting *DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE*
for you. You will need to use python manage.py shell in these examples, or Django will throw 
an exception.
